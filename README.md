:

🚀 Development of CUST Network – Cisco Packet Tracer Project
This project presents the design and simulation of a scalable, secure, and efficient campus network for Capital University of Science and Technology (CUST) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal was to create a reliable and future-proof infrastructure to support academic and administrative operations.

📌 Key Features
Ring topology for centralized faculty communication

EIGRP for dynamic, efficient routing

VLAN segmentation to ensure traffic isolation and enhanced security

Subnetting for organized IP management across departments

Simulated and validated using Cisco Packet Tracer

🎯 Objectives
Improve network performance and scalability

Enhance security and traffic control using VLANs

Minimize latency and simplify network management

Build a modular design adaptable to university expansion

🛠️ Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer

Subnetting Calculator

CLI commands for configuring EIGRP, VLANs, and IP addressing

📘 Outcome
The final network design successfully met the needs of a modern campus environment, demonstrating strong performance, ease of management, and flexibility for future upgrades. This project provides a practical framework for educational institutions looking to develop or upgrade their network infrastructure.
